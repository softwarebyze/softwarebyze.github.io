        https://frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp/html#on-your-own

        If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities. Include:

        What is this hobby exactly?
        
        How does it make you feel?
        
        Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?
        
        Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action
        
        Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do
        
        If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.
